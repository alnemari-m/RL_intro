# Deep learning Q 
### Objetivies : 
1. Understand Reinforcment Learnign  
2. Understand the algorthim deep learning Q
3. Implement deep learning Q from Scratch 
4. How deep-Q related to other like policy gradient, actor critic 


## Reinforcement learning


![alt text](images/core_concepts.png)
- Agent
  ![alt text](images/rl.png)
  
- reward

- values and max values

- Environment 
  
- Actions 
* discreate << q-learning  
* continuous 


## Markov Decision Process .. 
state depend only on previous state and actions 

value function = markov property + policy 
Bellman Equations 




agent interact with environment and have reward. 
for q-learnign for example, agent try to maximize its 
quality with every move in order to reach to the goal. 

when you use deep-q we have deep learning, to find the 
best place we are moving by backprobagete the loss function 



1. model-free vs model-based 
2. value-based vs policy-based
3. off-policy vs on-policy

## Q-learning 
how to improve the reward from the environment ? 
discrate-envromnemt 
in python you need like history
you can do this using python dictonary
